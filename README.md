This repository contains the homework subjects of the **Advanced Computational Techniques** course, **AUTHORS**, **LICENCE**, and a **README** file.

We picked two subjects among the three subjects proposed:
- Project #2: **Sparse matrices in Fortran**
- Project #3: **Molecular Dynamics in C**

The other **README** and **INSTALL** files will be found in Project#X folders, as they are specific for each homework.

#### Note
- The **AUTHORS** and **LICENCE** files remain unchanged and are applicable to both projects.
